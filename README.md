Stakeholder: Moreno , marketing analytics team, executive team
Prepare
  The data itself https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html the data is organized by date and its credible since it has license and published by a company
 Process 
  The tool chosen to do the project is r studio some changes is done for the dataset like adding the ride duration which use the time in the start and end on the dataset itself and also extracted the day when the ride happened
 and of course merging and making the dataset consistent is also done
 Analyze
  the data is aggregated and mutated to show only the column that is needed for the analyze the column like id is dropped since it wont be useful and trend analysis is also done with technique like using the mean ,or summarize to show the summary of the dataset for example the average ride length or the total count of the ride from different start + end station
 Act
  the top three recomendation from the analysis is that :
•	Using social media to promote the different price in the package between member pass and usual pass in the long term and give discount to the member pass which includes discount for casual which has used the pass.
•	Target on start station and end station where the casual member usually has the highest number of ride which is the lake shore dr & Monroe st to streeter dr & grand ave to promote the membership program which will increase the member from the casual type member
•	Having promotion and different prices on the Friday – Sunday since it has the longest ride length for the member promotion on becoming member while the prices on weekend is higher which will allow them to choose become member where else promotion on changing from casual to member is included for the first year
